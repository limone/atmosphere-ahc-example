### Atmosphere + Async HTTP Client Example

A very basic example of how to use the AHC to connect to an Atmosphere 
web socket implementation.

##### Usage

1. Deploy the WAR to Jetty (tested against 8.1.1 - any websocket compliant 
servlet container should work)
1. Run the test client
1. Sob with joy

##### Notes

* I deployed using WTP under Eclipse

##### Why?

Because JMS requires another port, or more software.
